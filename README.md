This Aseprite extension adds "Import LPC Character" to the File menu.
Use it to import a character sheet generated by the Universal LPC Character Generator.

The 7 standard animations can be fully imported with tags. Numbers are appended to indicate direction. They are chosen for easier conversion between angle and direction index, assuming a standard 2D graphics coordinate system where +X = right and +Y = down.
- 0 = right
- 1 = down
- 2 = left
- 3 = up


Large weapons may add extra 128x128 or 192x192 animations below the standard ones.
Provided you set the sprite size accordingly to 128 or 192, these are simply imported row-by-row as animations extra0, extra1, extra2...
It is not currently possible for the script to know if these are walking, attacking, etc. You'll have to work with them manually.
